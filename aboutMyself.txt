I am Christian Jeron Sintor. I took up BS Nursing in college.
My hobbies are watching Netflix, playing video games, reading manga and taking care of my pets.
In the future, I would like to be able to work as a full time Fullstack Developer for an International tech company. My goal in 5 years is to be a senior level Developer.
